*This post was originally posted on [eggschool.org](eggschool.org) on October 13,
2025 with the title "A clarification about the EGG board". We publish it here
unchanged.*   

<!--more-->

As you might have noticed, the structure of the EGG board/organizers changed a
bit (here you find the current members:
[https://www.eggschool.org/organizers/](https://www.eggschool.org/organizers/)).
In this post, we would like to briefly clarify the background of these changes.

So far, the EGG board consisted of the following members:

* 2 phonology members (Tobias Scheer and Eugeniusz Cyran) 
* 1 syntax member (Magdalena Lohninger) 
* 1 semantics member (Deniz Özildız and Berit Gehrke “shared” this seat) 
* 1 logistics member (Petra Charvat)

There have been discrepancies within the EGG board for multiple years now, mainly concerning the following topics: 


* **imposing a gender quota** which regulates that an even amount of
  female/diverse and male teachers are invited to the school. Tobias and
  Eugeniusz refused a gender quota with the result of a predominantly male
  line-up of phonology teachers: from 2016-2025, the phonology track hosted 32
  male and only 3 female teachers. In comparison, the syntax and semantics
  line-ups, for which the other board members were responsible, show an even
  distribution (syntax: 25 male & 25 female; semantics: 25 male & 23 female)
* **having a Code of Conduct (CoC)** for the summer school. Over the last years
  there were repeated incidents of (unwanted) sexual attention between
  participants (including teachers and students) at various EGG summer schools.
  Based on this, Deniz, Magdalena, Berit and Petra suggested having a CoC in the
  style LSA provides
  ([https://www.lsadc.org/lsa_code_of_conduct_for_events](https://www.lsadc.org/lsa_code_of_conduct_for_events)).
  Tobias and Eugeniusz rejected a CoC of any kind, which Tobias compared to a
  restriction of free speech and an “oppressive regime based on denunciation”.
  Tobias pointed out that there were women “who in fact want sexual attention,
  even if uncalled for”, and suggested that the “orgy and party” image EGG
  supposedly had would attract several students and teachers (even after another
  board member pointed out that this image would often scare away students from
  attending and discourage professors from sending their students to the EGG).
* **grant an equal voting right to everyone involved in organizing the school.**
  Tobias and Eugeniusz insisted that only the following members have a right to
  vote (on decisions like the gender quota, the CoC, teacher line-ups and the
  yearly location of the school): the two phonology members (Tobias and
  Eugeniusz) and the two syntax & semantics members (Deniz and Magdalena). They
  rejected for the logistics member (Petra) and the second semantics member
  (Berit) to participate in votes with the reasoning “that they are not proper
  board members”. Even though Petra and Berit did the majority of organizational
  work and attended most of the last years’ summer schools (whilst Tobias was
  only partly present and Eugeniusz never attended any school during his 5 year
  involvement in the board), they refused to change this voting system. (Note
  that none of this board/voting structure is set in written statutes or
  anything alike, nor has it been agreed upon by all current board members (in
  fact, Petra, for most years, was not even informed that she had no voting
  right.))
* **a democratic and equitable board setup**, in which every track has an even
  number of members (we proposed the following versions: 2 phonology + 2
  semantics + 2 syntax members or 1 phonology + 1 semantics + 1 syntax member +
  1-2 logistics members). All options were refused by the two phonologists
  (Tobias’ reasoning was “that the phonology side would then lose its 50% of
  votes”).

During this summer, we repeatedly tried to settle things within the EGG board
and proposed various changes and compromises, none of which Tobias agreed to. In
the course of this, Eugeniusz left the board and was intermittently replaced by
Alex Chabot. Even though Alex did not know anything about the exact board setup
and the previous discussions, he objected to changing the board/voting
structure. [NOTE: we rephrased this last sentence because it was not clear what
Alex voted on in the previous version.]

Therefore, we, that is **four of the previously six board members** (Petra, Deniz,
Berit & Magdalena) decided to change the EGG board structure to something we
deem more democratic and equitable (1 syntax + 1 semantics + 1 phonology + 2
logistics/general support members) and submitted a proposal for funding to the
Van Riemsdijk Foundation in this constellation. We offered Tobias (and later
Alex) the still-vacant phonology spot, as this was not an effort to boycott them
as persons, but to grant an equal voting right to everyone involved in
organizing. Both of them declined. 

We hope that restructuring the board will lead to fairer votes, a better
distribution of work between the three subfields and a shift to a more open and
diverse school.
