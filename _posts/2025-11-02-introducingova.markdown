Hello everyone,

as many of you are aware, the board of the EGG summer school split up in
September 2025. This post is to say that we (Berit, Deniz, Lena and Petra) will
continue organizing the school under its new name, **OVA**. 

With this change, we wish to avoid a situation in which there would have been
two competing summer schools with the same name. Not only is this is confusing
and uncomfortable, but students, teachers, hosts and funders should not have to
bear the burden of making difficult decisions or 'take sides' just because we
did.

This change opens a new chapter for the school, defined by a more transparent
and fair organizatonal body, and one capable of standing for basic principles of
safety, inclusivity and gender representation. (To read more on why the former
EGG board was incapable of guaranteeing this, see here.)

The principles that you are used to from the EGG remain unchanged: OVA is a
summer school on generative linguistics taught by leading members of our field
and hosted by different Eastern European countries. It offers student-friendly
pricing and financial support for students from former countries of the Eastern
Bloc. It is a venue for informal exchanges as well as stimulating intellectual
work.

We hope to see many of you at OVA in 2026 and the upcoming years!

Your OVA board,
Berit, Deniz, Lena and Petra
