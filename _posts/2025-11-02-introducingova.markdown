# after the whole discussion about EGG (which many of you probably are aware of;
# here is a summary why the EGG board separated [LINK to our original statement]),
# we eventually decided to change the name of our (Berit, Petra, Deniz, Lena)
# school to OVA.

Hello everyone,

as many of you are aware, the board of the EGG summer school split up in
September 2025. This post is to say that we (Berit, Deniz, Lena and Petra) will
continue organizing the school under its new name, **OVA**. 

With this change, we wish to avoid a situation in which there would have been
two competing summer schools with the same name. Not only is this is confusing
and uncomfortable, but students, teachers, hosts and funders should not have to
bear the burden of making difficult decisions or 'take sides' just because we
did.

This change opens a new chapter for the school, defined by a more transparent
and fair organizatonal body, and one capable of standing for basic principles of
safety, inclusivity and gender representation. (To read more on why the former
EGG board was incapable of guaranteeing this, see here.)

The principles that you are used to from the EGG remain unchanged: OVA is a
summer school on generative linguistics taught by leading members of our field
and hosted by different Eastern European countries. It offers student-friendly
pricing and financial support for students from former countries of the Eastern
Bloc. It is a venue for informal exchanges as well as stimulating intellectual
work.

We hope to see many of you at OVA in 2026 and the upcoming years!

Your OVA board,
Berit, Deniz, Lena and Petra

# students, teachers and organizers 
# , hosted by changing Eastern
# European institutions, with an emphasis on student-friendly pricing, financial
# support for students from former Soviet countries, and flat hierarchies among
# teachers, organizers and students. 
# 
# This has the following reasons; Tobias Scheer still claims rights on the name
# EGG and does not acknowledge us (Berit, Petra, Deniz, Lena) as organizers
# whereby it might be the case that there are two EGG schools in 2026. This is
# confusing for everyone (especially for those who didn’t follow the discussion in
# much detail), might have a negative impact on funding sources and places the
# burden of making a ‘political decision’ on teachers and local hosts when
# engaging with our school. We want to be clear which school is which, therefore
# we decided to go by OVA from now on. Similarly, we think that changing the name
# marks that we are stepping into a new era of EGG, defined by clearer statutes,
# an equitable board setup, and more conscious decisions on inclusiveness.
# 
# The modalities of OVA remain the same (what you are used from the EGG): it still
# is a summer school on generative linguistics, hosted by changing Eastern
# European institutions, with an emphasis on student-friendly pricing, financial
# support for students from former Soviet countries, and flat hierarchies among
# teachers, organizers and students. 
# 
# The main reason for this change is that some former members of the EGG board
# still claim rights 
# 
# We remain committed to offering a summer school that is  
# 
# In its past form, the board was incapable of guaranteeing a
# safe and inclusive venue
# 
# fulfilling its
# commitment to a safe and inclusive venue and to guaranteeing equal
# representation


# Along with the name, we changed our website, and you now find us here:
# https://ovaschool.github.io. The old website is no longer working.

# Only for FB/instagram: Last, we will also change the name of this facebook
# group, since it is solely run by us (the organizers of OVA), not Tobias or Alex.
# Please feel free to leave the group if you no longer want to be updated about
# OVA.
