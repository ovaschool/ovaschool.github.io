Hello everyone,

as many of you are aware, the board of the EGG summer school split up in
September 2025. This post is to say that we, four of the former EGG members (Berit, Deniz, Lena and Petra) will
continue organizing a school, **OVA**. 

<!--more-->

OVA is defined by a transparent
and fair organizational body, and one capable of standing for basic principles of
safety, inclusivity and gender representation (the former
EGG board was incapable of guaranteeing this, which is why we left). 

OVA is a summer school on generative linguistics taught by leading members of our field
and hosted by different Eastern European countries. It offers student-friendly
pricing and financial support for students from former countries of the Eastern
Bloc. It is a venue for informal exchanges as well as stimulating intellectual
work.

We hope to see many of you at OVA in 2026 and the upcoming years!

Your OVA board,  
Berit, Deniz, Lena and Petra
