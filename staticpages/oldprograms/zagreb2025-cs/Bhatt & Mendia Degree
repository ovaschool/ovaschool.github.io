Natural languages exhibit a number of phenomena that have been used to motivate the introduction of “degrees” as part of our semantic ontology. For instance: gradable adjectives like “tall” and quantity adjectives like “much”, numerals, measure phrases, comparative, equative and superlative constructions, all have been proposed to be better understood and analyzed by resorting to degrees. Our goal in this class is to explore degree semantic theories, starting off by focusing on theories motivated by the most foundational phenomena, and then moving on to more recent applications of the basic theories (including topics such as modified numerals, exclamatives, verbs, event structures, amount relatives and even modality), according to preferences in the classroom.
