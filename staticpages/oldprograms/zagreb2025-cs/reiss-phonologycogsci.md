This course will consider very simple phonological  phenomena in the context of ‘big picture’ issues in linguistics and cognitive science,  such as<br/> 

* how to understand neutralization patterns in terms of formal logic
* the Subset Principle in phonology
* epistemic boundedness in phonology 
* the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus in phonology
* the initial state and the learning path in phonology
* empiricism and rationalism with respect to features and syllable structure—what can a child  learn from experience and what must be built-in?
