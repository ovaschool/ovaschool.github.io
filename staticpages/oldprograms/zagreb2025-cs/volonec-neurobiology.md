This advanced course surveys the essential topics and current issues in the cognitive neuroscience of language and speech. It covers the anatomy and physiology of the human nervous system, language- and speech-related networks in the brain, the neural substrates of semantics, syntax, morphology, phonology, speech production and perception, language impairments (aphasias), and addresses the notorious problem of unifying the mind (cognition) and the brain (neural activity).<br/>
