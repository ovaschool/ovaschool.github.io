Autosegmental phonology is the theory of phonological representations, and it claims that sound patterns and processes can be described and explained with reference to hierarchical structure that can be represented by tree diagrams (relations of association between higher-order and lower-order constituents). The course aims to show how this approach provides solutions to some of the theoretical and empirical issues (especially overgeneration and improper empirical coverage) surrounding the classical (‘SPE-type’ / ‘linear’) model of Generative Phonology. It discusses the concept of the local source (the ‘Non-Arbitrariness Principle’); the skeleton; long-distance phonological relations (tones, vowel harmony); templatic (root-and-pattern) morphophonology; the operations of spreading and de-linking; the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP); multi-dimensional prosodic and subsegmental structure (‘feature/element geometry’); one-to-many mapping; empty categories. Finally, we take a quick glance at current representation-based phonology and its two main strands that can be described as ‘hyperhierarchical’ (or ‘vertical’) and ‘flat’ (or ‘horizontal’). Bring a spare pen because we are going to draw a lot!<br/>
