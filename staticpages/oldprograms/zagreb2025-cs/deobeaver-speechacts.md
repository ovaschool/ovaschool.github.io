**Ashwini Deo & David Beaver: Speech Acts: Undertaking and Influencing Commitments**<br/>

Course material [here](https://shorturl.at/AdbrU)<br/>

This course examines key linguistic phenomena that have shaped commitment-based dynamic pragmatic models and explores how such models account for speech acts that can be said to express a call on the addressee, e.g., those containing tag questions, utterance-final discourse markers, or vocatives.<br/>

Dynamic models of discourse treat communication as a coordinated activity in which interlocutors undertake, negotiate, and influence public commitments—both doxastic and practical—through the discourse moves they perform. The simplest moves are utterances where a single morphosyntactic element, such as clause type  (declarative, interrogative, imperative), an explicit performative verb, or a response particle functions as the primary marker of illocutionary force, signaling a speaker’s commitment status.<br/>

Articulated strategies in which multiple linguistic elements contribute distinct but integrated components of speech act structure have also been investigated, mostly in the context of biased (or non-canonical) questions. These complex discourse strategies are analyzed in different ways, e.g. as encoding degrees of speaker credence in a proposition or as involving conjoined/disjoined speech acts or as effecting complex changes to the scoreboard that trigger pragmatic reasoning.<br/>

We will explore the view that such strategies, which anticipate the addressee’s commitments or reactions, express the speaker’s preferences as to how the conversational state evolves.<br/>

Using data primarily from English and Indo-Aryan languages, the course aims to introduce students to the theoretical grounding, analytical methods, and formal tools needed to study commitment-influencing linguistic strategies across languages. These investigations bear on broader questions in semantics and pragmatics about the marking of speech acts, the fine-grained interactionally-oriented organization of utterances, and how language facilitates the negotiation of speaker and addressee commitments.
