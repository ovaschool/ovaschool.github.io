Languages differ as to how many series of obstruents they distinguish by some laryngeal specification and what the phonetic manifestation of the contrast is. The course focusses on VOT-based binary systems, typically found in European languages and described in the SPE-style tradition in terms of [+/- voice]. The fundamental tenet of Laryngeal Realism (LR) (or “the narrow interpretation of [voice]”) is that a distinction must be drawn between (i) languages in which the contrast is based on vocal cord activity, i.e., voicing in the strict sense (the so-called voice languages, or Glottal Tension languages), and (ii) languages in which the obstruents traditionally analysed as voiced vs. voiceless actually contrast in negative or zero vs. positive VOT (the classical lenis vs. fortis distinction; in so-called aspiration, or [spread glottis], or Glottal Width languages). This is because the apparently phonetic difference between these two language types is of phonological relevance as it has serious consequences for the patterning of the whole system of obstruents (the exact mechanism of consonant lenition and voice assimilation; asymmetries in other voice-related phonological processes). While most of LR seeks to identify links between phonetic realisation (of, esp., utterance-initial plosives) and phonology, some of its strands, most notably the approach dubbed Laryngeal Relativism, adhere to a more (or purely) phonological interpretation of the language typology. The course discusses data from English, Hungarian, Swedish, Polish, Italian, Ukrainian and Basque, to survey claims and arguments put forth in laryngeally realistic and relativistic analyses.<br/>

Students are encouraged to bring along data from languages of their choice to test the theoretical claims.<br/>
