Course material [here](https://bit.ly/egg2025_synt_intro_week1)<br/>

This course offers an introduction to generative syntax. In the first part, we’ll cover core concepts of the framework—such as Merge, Agree, selection, projection, and movement—and apply them to phenomena like agreement and information structure. We’ll focus on the lower part of the sentence structure (below TP), laying the groundwork for the topics to be explored in Part II during the second week.
