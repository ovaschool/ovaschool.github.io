This course is an introduction to the Autosegmental-Metrical framework for studying sentence-level prosody and intonation. A major goal will be to cover the basics of phonological transcription of intonation, concentrating first on English intonation using the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) system. Towards the end of the class, we will contrast the structure of English with some of the other languages that have been well studied in the AM framework (e.g., Japanese, Korean, Bengali, possibly French) and discuss a broader prosodic typology. This course will provide tools for sophisticated prosodic analysis that can be applied to the study of phenomena in segmental phonetics and phonology, syntax, semantics, information structure, and sentence processing, to name a few. An emphasis will be on relating our phonological model of prosodic and intonational structure to these other areas of inquiry.<br/>
