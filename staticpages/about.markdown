### What is OVA?

The OVA (Omnes Voces Acceptamus) Summer School is an alternative to the EGG (Eastern Generative Grammar) Summer School. In 2025, the organizing team of EGG split up, and four of the six board members went on to create OVA — a school defined by a transparent and fair organizational body, and one capable of standing for basic principles of safety, inclusivity and gender representation.

OVA's goal is to offer an affordable program in generative linguistics, particularly in regions where access to generative syntax, semantics and phonology had historically been limited, for political and/or economical reasons.


### Costs and student grants

Our aim is to offer a summer school accessible to everyone, providing an affordable alternative to other linguistic summer schools in Europe and North America. The registration fee is usually around €250-€350 and covers classes as well as accommodation in university-provided dorms for both weeks.


Depending on the financial situation in a given year, we offer grants for low-income students and those from Eastern European countries. Students can apply for financial support as part of the registration process.


### What you learn at the OVA

The OVA school offers both introductory and advanced courses in syntax, semantics, and phonology — something for everyone, at all levels of their academic career. Teachers often attend and participate in one another’s classes, creating an atmosphere of mutual learning and collaboration.


The introductory courses assume little to no prior technical knowledge and aim to give a crashcourse-intro into the given subfield. The advanced courses, by contrast, reflect the instructors’ own areas of expertise and provide insights into cutting-edge research across phonology, semantics, and syntax, showcasing a range of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.


We also encourage and support students in organizing an open podium, where they can present their ongoing research and receive feedback from fellow participants. In addition, we offer optional workshops — often led by students — covering practical skills such as LaTeX, statistics, abstract writing, and other methods useful for linguistic research.


### OVA teachers

At OVA, we believe in fostering new ideas from outstanding early-career
researchers. Unlike many other schools, we are delighted to invite junior
scholars when we believe their perspectives will enrich the program. Of course,
our program also features several established researchers, though the balance
tends to be the reverse of what you might find elsewhere.  

We strive to maintain a flat hierarchy between students and teachers, creating
an open environment that encourages curiosity, creative research, and the
exchange of ideas among linguists at all career stages.

We also uphold a gender balance in selecting our instructors — not only to
support the careers of young researchers equally, but also to provide students
with a range of diverse and inspiring role models.

### The OVA mentality

We aim to keep the barrier between students and teachers as low as possible — everyone is welcome, stays in the same dorms, and students, teachers, and organizers often spend time together outside the regular school hours. This informal atmosphere is meant to allow all participants, students and teachers, to spend time working on linguistics in a friendly and open setting. 


There will be plenty of socializing outside the classroom at OVA. To ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe, OVA also has a Code of Conduct that applies to all participants.
