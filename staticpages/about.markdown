### What is OVA?

The OVA (Omnes Voces Acceptamus) Summer School is the successor to what was
formerly known as the EGG (Eastern Generative Grammar) School. Since 1994, the
EGG has been held annually in former communist countries across Central and
Eastern Europe. The original goal of the school was to offer an affordable
program in generative linguistics, particularly in regions where access to
generative syntax and semantics had been limited — first for political reasons
during the communist era, and later for economic reasons in the early
post-communist years.

### Why EGG is OVA

In 2025, the organizing team of EGG split up, and four of the six board members
went on to create OVA — a more inclusive and democratically organized
continuation of EGG. If you’re interested in the full story, you can read more
in this blog post [LINK] and this one about the name change [LINK].

### Costs and student grants

Today, the main aim of OVA remains to offer a summer school accessible to
everyone, providing an affordable alternative to other linguistic summer schools
in Europe and North America. The registration fee is usually around €250-€350
and covers classes as well as accommodation in university-provided dorms for
both weeks.  

Depending on the financial situation in a given year, we also offer grants for
low-income students and those from Eastern European countries.  Students can
apply for financial support as part of the registration process.

### What you learn at the OVA

OVA offers both introductory and advanced courses in syntax, semantics, and
phonology — something for everyone. Teachers often attend and participate in one
another’s classes, creating an atmosphere of mutual learning and collaboration.


The introductory courses are open to all and assume little to no prior technical
knowledge. The advanced courses, by contrast, reflect the instructors’ own areas
of expertise and provide insights into cutting-edge research across phonology,
semantics, and syntax, showcasing a range of theoretical perspectives and
methodologies.

We also encourage and support students in organizing an _open podium_, where
they can present their ongoing research and receive feedback from fellow
participants. In addition, we offer optional workshops — often led by students —
covering practical skills such as LaTeX, statistics, abstract writing, and other
methods useful for linguistic research.

### OVA teachers

At OVA, we believe in fostering new ideas from outstanding early-career
researchers. Unlike many other schools, we are delighted to invite junior
scholars when we believe their perspectives will enrich the program. Of course,
our program also features several established researchers, though the balance
tends to be the reverse of what you might find elsewhere.  

We strive to maintain a flat hierarchy between students and teachers, creating
an open environment that encourages curiosity, creative research, and the
exchange of ideas among linguists at all career stages.

We also uphold a gender balance in selecting our instructors — not only to
support the careers of young researchers equally, but also to provide students
with a range of diverse and inspiring role models.

### The OVA mentality

Much of OVA’s spirit reflects the same mindset that shaped EGG. We aim to keep
the barrier between students and teachers as low as possible — everyone stays in
the same dorms, and students, teachers, and organizers often spend time
together. This informal atmosphere is meant to encourage open interaction and
discussion.  

Just like at EGG, there will be plenty of socializing outside the classroom at
OVA. To ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe, OVA also has a Code of
Conduct that applies to all participants.
