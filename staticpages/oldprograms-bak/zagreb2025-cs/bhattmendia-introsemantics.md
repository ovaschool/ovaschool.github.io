**Jon Ander Mendia: Introduction to intensional semantics** (week 2)<br/>

Course material:
* [week 1](tinyurl.com/yrmatbkr) 
* [week 2](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zlj024s4040z8ca76tdkl/ADZcVauKWMLmpeJsqEhP83s?rlkey=rzkisv0uxreeul0hxrwknerz2&e=2&st=w7jwrdi5&dl=0) 

The goal of this course is to expand students’ understanding of the empirical domain and techniques in formal semantics and to develop the skills to do independent semantic analysis. The semantic system that we will develop has two central tenets. First, following the long tradition initiated by logicians like Frege, Tarski, Carnap and Montague, it aims at developing a truth conditional semantic system, one where the meaning of a sentence is determined by stating the conditions under which it is true in the world. Second, the semantic system that we will develop is compositional, i.e. it determines a systematic procedure that allows us to obtain the meaning of each sentence from the meaning of its parts. In the first half of the course we will learn standard formal tools which we will then apply and develop during the second half to a analyze a range of empirical phenomena, including adjectival modification, quantifiers and (in)definites, pronouns, etc.

In the second week, the course will provide a thorough and advanced introduction to the phenomenon of “intensionality” in natural language, the core techniques and results of intensional (often referred to as “possible-world”) semantics, as  well as discussion of various foundational issues and results in formal semantics. <br/>

During the first three days we will examine in depth the semantics of sentential complements, the de re / de dicto distinction, and modal auxiliaries. Then, for the rest of the course and depending on the interests of the students, we will explore two among various topics so as to employ the analytic tools gained from these studies. Some such topics include, for instance, conditionals, interrogative clauses and tense/aspect morphology, concealed questions, etc.<br/>
